# AggieApp---2024-
# Right now, students are required to use aggie access in their day to day 
#lives and for other services offered by the school. Aggie Access, while easily accessible on a laptop is not as easily accessible on mobile
#devices and you can do it in your browser, but it isnâ€™t formatted for mobile devices which can lead to a waste of time or the website glitching out.  
# Project Description 		 
# My program will be an app for the Aggie Access website
#to be more accessible to users on mobile devices and give them access 
#to their student profile and look at their schedules and give access to their transcripts. 
#This will be useful for students that regularly frequent the app and make it more convenient for them. 
#I plan on using python and or java using Kivy a python framework app builder.
